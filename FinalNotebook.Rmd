# When I wrote the initial code for this project, I broke our project goals into smaller steps: getting genome sequence from the NCBI, finding start and stop codons, transcription, translation, and resulting in an amino acid sequence. The basis for this project was basically BioPython, which is why we wrote it in Python. My code certainly worked, and laid a good foundation for what we needed to learn in order to make the project more user friendly. Some problems with my code are that you have to manually save the genome sequence on your computer and then edit the code in order for the program to find it and do what it is supposed to. Another problem is that I did not figure out how to get it to result in an amino acid sequence. However all of this was good practice for me to see how we could make this project better. A copy of my code is below: 
import re
codon = []
rcodon = []

#open file and assign to a variable 
f = open("C:/Users/Allison Derry/Documents/OBU Computing 2/hsv-1 genome sequence.txt", "r")
#read the file into a variable
dataset = f.read()
#remove digits from dataset
dataset = re.sub('[0-9]', "", dataset)
# remove //
dataset = re.sub('//', "", dataset)
#remove origin
dataset = re.sub('ORIGIN', "", dataset)
#remove new lines
dataset = re.sub('\n', "", dataset)
#remove spaces
dataset = re.sub(' ',"", dataset)
#locate start codons
startcodon=0
n=0
while(n < 1):
	startcodon=dataset.find("atg", startcodon, len(dataset)-startcodon)
	#locate stop codons
	taacodon=dataset.find("taa", startcodon+3, len(dataset)-startcodon)
	tagcodon=dataset.find("tag", startcodon+3, len(dataset)-startcodon)
	tgacodon=dataset.find("tga", startcodon+3, len(dataset)-startcodon)
	if(taacodon<tagcodon):
		if(taacodon<tgacodon):
			stopcodon=taacodon
			#print("taacodon", startcodon)
		else:
			stopcodon=tgacodon
			#print("tGacodon", startcodon)
	
	elif(tgacodon>tagcodon):
		stopcodon=tagcodon
		#print("taGcodon", startcodon)
	else:
		stopcodon=tgacodon
		#print("tGacodon", startcodon)
	#to add sequences to an array
	codon.append(dataset[startcodon:stopcodon+3])
	if(startcodon > len(dataset) or startcodon < 0):
		n = 2;
	startcodon=stopcodon

#transcription
n=0;
while(n < len(codon)):
        rcodon.append (codon[n][len(codon[n])::-1])
        #replace a with u
        rcodon[n] = re.sub('a', "u", rcodon[n])
        #replace t with a
        rcodon[n] = re.sub('t', "a", rcodon[n])
        #replace c with x
        rcodon[n] = re.sub('c', "x", rcodon[n])
        #replace g with c
        rcodon[n] = re.sub('g', "c", rcodon[n])
        #replace x with g
        rcodon[n] = re.sub('x', "g", rcodon[n])
        print("DNA sequence: ", codon[n] ,'\n', "RNA sequence:", rcodon[n])
        n=n+1
answer = 0
print("Total Sequences:  ", len(codon)-3)
while (int(answer) >= 0):
        #str = "Please enter an integer from 0 to " + str(len(dataset)) + " or -1 to quit: "
        answer = int(input("Please enter an sequence you would like to see or -1 to quit:  "))
        if(int(answer) >= 0):
                print("DNA sequence: ", codon[int(answer)] ,'\n', "RNA sequence:", rcodon[int(answer)])


# Emma then wrote the code so that it would translate the sequence into an amino acid sequence. 
# Finally, Lauren was able to take those two components and put them together in order to create a simpler version of what we wrote and make it so
